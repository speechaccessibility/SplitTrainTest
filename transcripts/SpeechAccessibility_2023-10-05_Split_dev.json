This one was (a) one that probably not be (a-) advisable for children today and probably wouldn't even be on the market today, especially here in the USA. It was the story about what would happen to children when they didn't obey their parents. For instance, one boy, he kept sucking his thumbs all the time, which he wasn't supposed to do, so the tailor came and cut off his thumbs. Or they were playing with matches, so they caught fire and they burned up. (Or) What was another one? Let me see. (Um uh) The one where (th-) he wouldn't eat his soup, and he wouldn't eat, and so he got thinner and thinner 'til he died. (So these were all stories that were rather) They always had (a) a rather peculiar ending, and not one that (what we ever) what we would want our children to hear today.
