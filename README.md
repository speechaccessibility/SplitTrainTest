# Standard Train/Dev/Test Split for the Speech Accessibility Project

This repository provides the train/dev/test split for each release of the Speech Accessibility Corpus, and describes how each such split was generated.

If you don't know what you want, then you probably want the draft standard train/dev/test split of the most recent release of the corpus:
